        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hi, my name is Nathan, welcome to my online portfolio representative of some of the more creative-inclined work within my collegiate experience at both Heartland Community College and Illinois State University. I transferred to ISU's CTK Audio and Music Production sequence after recieving my prerequisite A.A. Heartland, and am currently on track for a B.S. with a focus in Audio and Music Production. I have only just begun my formal education within the field of audio and music production, however, I've dipped my toe in the metaphorical pond in the past; if only motivated through personal growth in a field of interest. I've been working within Digital Audio Workstations for a few years as I've always been musically-inclined and interested, but I likely wouldn't have created the content I have today without ISU's CTK program. Specifically in terms of instrumentation I have been playing guitar for a bit over a decade, which has translated to amature bass ability, I dabble in some piano, nothing traditional or of note in the slightest, and I program digital drums. I also have some experience in working live sound and performing on stage through mediums of guitar and vocals.</p>
